A personal project to rebuild my website, an online showcase for my artistic practice.
What it is: A single-page app, featuring images of my artworks. To give context to the individual works, 
I decided to emphasize exhibitions and bodies of work, using install shots that show them within a gallery space.

To enhance the user experience, I implemented Bootstrap's Scrollspy so that the navigation bar automatically updates with the 
currently active section of the page as the user scrolls. This means you can browse the entire site without a single click of the mouse.
If you do want to jump ahead, clicking on any link will take you directly to that section of the page.

I also wanted to include some of my newer video projects, which had to be embedded via iframes. With responsive design in mind, I used
responsive embed tags that maintain a fixed 16x9 aspect ratio, so that the videos can scale with the page but won't incur strange 
artifacts that might otherwise distort the picture.
